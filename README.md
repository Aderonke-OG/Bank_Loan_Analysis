# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard (Power BI & SQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers an interactive **Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **DAX** to analyze loan applications, funding performance, repayments, and credit risk.

The solution transforms raw loan data into actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making for banking and lending operations.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Monitor overall loan application and funding performance
- Track **Month-to-Date (MTD)** and **Month-over-Month (MoM)** trends
- Analyze **Good vs Bad Loan** distribution
- Identify high-risk borrower segments
- Understand loan behavior by **state, term, purpose, employment length, and home ownership**
- Support credit risk assessment and portfolio optimization

---

## 📈 Key Metrics (KPIs)
- Total Loan Applications
- Total Funded Amount
- Total Amount Received
- Average Interest Rate
- Average Debt-to-Income (DTI)
- Good Loan vs Bad Loan Percentage
- MTD & MoM Performance Indicators

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- 86.2% of loans are classified as Good Loans, indicating a healthy portfolio
- Loan applications and repayments show a consistent upward monthly trend
- Debt consolidation is the dominant loan purpose
- 60-month loan terms are more popular than 36-month terms
- Borrowers with 10+ years employment history contribute the highest loan value
- Bad loans are associated with higher interest rates and higher DTI
- Loan activity is concentrated in high-population states
